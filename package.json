  "description": "This repository is dedicated to my project for a panel used to manage URL redirects. The primary functionality of the system is to receive a specified URL and then redirect the user to the appropriate address, enabling the creation of easy-to-remember, simple, and readable links. The system also includes a JWT-secured panel that allows for the creation of new links, deletion of old ones, updating existing links, and monitoring link-related statistics. The project was developed using the NestJS backend framework, and the frontend was built with Angular. The goal of the project is to practice implementing the most popular technologies in a practical application.",
